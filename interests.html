							<h1>My interests</h1>
                            <p class= "major">I have found interest in movies since I was 14 years old like most people, and at some point in our lives, the majority of us would have felt as though we had hit rock bottom. There's nothing wrong with admitting it, as acceptance is the first step to seeing things as they are and moving forward to better ourselves.</br> The alternative to moving forward can vary from one person to another. It could be a meaningful book for one, a motivational song for another, or an uplifting movie for someone else.</br> So here is Top 5 movies you should watch that changed my perspective on life!</p>
